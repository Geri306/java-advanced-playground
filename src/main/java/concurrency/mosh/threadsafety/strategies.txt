Strategies for writing thread-safe code:
- confinement
- immutability
- synchronisation - by using locks [AVOID IT] : forces the code to run sequentially (challenging & error-prone: dead-lock can happen -> threads wait for each other indefinitely)
- atomic objects
- partitioning data into segments that can be accessed concurrently
